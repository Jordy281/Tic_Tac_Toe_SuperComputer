# Tic_Tac_Toe_SuperComputer

This is a script that trains a computer to play Tic Tac Toe using a hidden markov model. The script can be executed using the TDZero-TicTacToe(1).py file. 

The script first creates all possible game states. The computer then uses a reward based system to train against a random computer. The computer trains going both first and second.

The file winningPercentage is used to calculate the efficiency of the super computer by playing out 1000 games using fully trained computers. It also includes graphing functions to show the learning rate of the super computer.

The user can then choose to let two computers battle it out or can ply against the computer. 

There is no GUI for this, so everything is text based.
